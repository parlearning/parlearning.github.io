</p>
<p><b>Scaling Deep Learning Algorithms on Extreme Scale Architectures</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
Deep Learning (DL) is ubiquitous. Yet leveraging distributed memory systems for DL algorithms is incredibly hard. In this talk, we will present approaches to bridge this critical gap.  We will start by scaling DL algorithms on large scale systems such as leadership class facilities (LCFs). Specifically, we will: 1) present our TensorFlow and Keras runtime extensions which require negligible changes in user-code for scaling DL implementations, 2) present communication-reducing/avoiding techniques for scaling DL implementations, 3) present  approaches on fault tolerant DL implementations, and 4) present research on semi-automatic pruning of DNN topologies. We will provide pointers and discussion on the general availability of our research under the umbrella of Machine Learning Toolkit on Extreme Scale (MaTEx) available at <a href="http://github.com/matex-org/matex">http://github.com/matex-org/matex</a></p>

He focuses on designing extreme scale Deep Learning algorithms that are capable of execution on supercomputers and cloud computing systems.  The specific objectives are to design user-transparent distributed TensorFlow;  novel communication reducing/approximation techniques for DL algorithms; fault tolerant Deep Learning/Machine Learning algorithms; multi-dimensional deep neural networks and applications of these techniques on several domains.  His research is publicly available as Machine Learning Toolkit for Extreme Scale (MaTEx) at <a href="http://github.com/matex-org/matex">http://github.com/matex-org/matex</a></p>

<p><b>Model Parallelism optimization with deep reinforcement learning</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>  
The past few years have witnessed a growth in size and computational requirements for training and inference with neural networks. Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this talk, I will present some of our recent efforts on learning to optimize model parallelism for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of deep reinforcement learning to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the deep model. Our main result is that on important computer vision, language modeling and neural machine translation tasks, our model finds non-trivial ways to parallelise the model that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algorithmic methods.</p>

<b>Thomas Parnell</b>, IBM Research – Zurich, Switzerland
</p>
<p><b>Introduction to Snap Machine Learning</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>  Generalized linear models, such as logistic regression and support vector machines, remain some of the most widely-used techniques in the machine learning field. Their enduring popularity can be attributed to their desirable theoretical properties, effective training algorithms, and relative ease of interpretability. In this talk we will introduce Snap Machine Learning: a new library for fast training of such models, that is designed to enable new real-time and large-scale applications. The library was designed from the ground up with performance in mind. It exploits parallelism at three different levels: across multiple machines in a network, across heterogeneous compute nodes within a machine (e.g. CPU and GPU), as well as the massive parallelism offered by modern GPUs. In this talk we will review this new architecture and give examples of how the library can be used via the various APIs that are provided (e.g. Python, Apache Spark, MPI). Finally, we will present benchmarking results using the publicly available Terabyte Click Logs dataset (from Criteo Labs) and show that Snap Machine Learning can train a logistic regression classifier in 1.53 minutes, 46x faster than any of the results that have been previously reported using the same dataset.</p>

<p><b>Matrix Factorization on GPUs: A Tale of Two Algorithms</b></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Matrix factorization (MF) is an approach to derive latent features from observations. It is at the heart of many algorithms, e.g., collaborative filtering, word embedding and link prediction. Alternating least Square (ALS) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are the two popular methods in solving MF. SGD converges fast, while ALS is easy to parallelize and able to deal with non-sparse ratings. In this talk, I will introduce cuMF(https://github.com/cuMF/), a CUDA-based matrix factorization library that accelerates both ALS and SGD to solve very large-scale MF. cuMF uses a set of techniques to maximize the performance on single and multiple GPUs. These techniques include smart access of sparse data leveraging memory hierarchy, using data parallelism with model parallelism, approximate algorithms and storage. With only a single machine with up to four Nvidia GPU cards, cuMF can be 10 times as fast, and 100 times as cost-efficient, compared with the state-of-art distributed CPU solutions. In this talk I will also share lessons learned in accelerating compute- and memory-intensive kernels on GPUs.</p>

Scaling up machine-learning (ML), data mining (DM) and reasoning algorithms from Artificial Intelligence (AI) for massive datasets is a major technical challenge in the time of &quot;Big Data&quot;. The past ten years have seen the rise of multi-core and GPU based computing. In parallel and distributed computing, several frameworks such as OpenMP, OpenCL, and Spark continue to facilitate scaling up ML/DM/AI algorithms using higher levels of abstraction. We invite novel works that advance the trio-fields of ML/DM/AI through development of scalable algorithms or computing frameworks.
